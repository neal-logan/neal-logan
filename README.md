## Hi there üëã

I'm Neal. My career has revolved around information flows in security contexts. I'm currently a graduate student in data science at UNC Charlotte.

### Passions üî•
- **Language+Semantics:** This has evolved from an enduring interest in foreign languages (Spanish, Japanese, Chinese-Mandarin, Dutch) to dabbling in linguistics and natural language processing with tools like [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/). More recently I've been working with large language models, mainly working to clarify immediate practical applications and limitations. I'm particularly intrigued by the apparently-untapped potential of semantic spaces and vector embeddings.
- **Automated Decision-Making:** It's more than training accurate models.  It's evaluating models in depth with tools like [PiML](https://github.com/SelfExplainML/PiML-Toolbox).  It's bridging the gap between modeling efforts and operational decisions, ensuring alignment between the way a model was trained and how it is used.  It's having [sound processes](https://leansixsigmainstitute.org/) to integrate those decisions into.  It's making sure your systems and processes give you the data you need to evaluate model performance and make smart, timely changes.  It's [model risk management](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm) and [human oversight requirements](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/).  Most of my experience in automated decision-making is in payments/deposits fraud detection, but I'm looking to branch out.
- **Interface/Experience Design:** Clarity and usability.  [Choice architecture](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1583509), plain language, [privacy by design](https://iapp.org/resources/article/oipc-privacy-by-design-resources/).  Customer journeys.  All just as relevant whether your customers are internal or external.
- **Agility:** Design simplicity and clarity for *everything*.  Continuous integration and delivery for *everything*.  Modular, testable systems.  Fast failure. 
Type safety. Containerization, infrastructure as code, continuous documentation.  Agility grows out of a [Grug-brained](https://grugbrain.dev/) attitude.

### Recent Projects üõ†Ô∏è

  <Summary>
     (Mid 2024) Model Development for Malicious URL Detection 
  </Summary><br> 
  
  [No Phishing](https://github.com/neal-logan/no-phishing), a small project to develop and evaluate a classification model for malicious URL detection, mainly using [PiML](https://selfexplainml.github.io/PiML-Toolbox/_build/html/index.html).

  <Summary>
     (Late 2024) Product Development with LLMs + RAG
  </Summary><br> 
  
  [MinuteMate](https://github.com/dsba6010-llm-applications/MinuteMate), a group semester project to develop and implement an LLM product to improve public access to public meetings (mainly formal public meetings) via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  It consists mainly of (1) a preprocessing pipeline which populates a vector database with useful vector-indexed chunks of text from meeting transcriptions, agendas, and minutes and (2) a chat app consisting of a backend that implements RAG-enhanced chat functionality and serves it to a public Streamlit frontend via an API.  To support this, we are deploying smaller open language models like Llama3, both locally and in the cloud, rather than relying strictly on existing model services. This was my first experience implementing something approaching proper CI for project development and will include capabilities for comprehensive testing and evaluation.  It is very much a work in progress.
