  <Summary>
     Product Development - LLMs + RAG
  </Summary><br> 
  
  [MinuteMate](https://github.com/dsba6010-llm-applications/MinuteMate), a group project to develop and implement an LLM product to improve access to meetings (mainly formal public meetings) and to provide some analysis of those meetings.  The project is based in large part on [Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba), a convenient framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provided by Weaviate.  It also involves deploying and running smaller LLMs, both locally and in the cloud, rather than relying strictly on LLM providers' APIs.  The project will be developed using a CI framework and will include comprehensive evaluation, testing, and refinement.  This is very much a work in progress.
